Shefki:
	- Fix a very rare error in the Eclipse module.
	Apparently GetEclipseDirection() can return nil in very rare situations.
	- Fix right click menu never working on group frames created in combat.
	Note: Due to an API limitation the right click menu won't start working
	until you leave combat.  This is due to the lack of RegisterForClicks.
	I've asked for it to be added and hopefully it'll make it into 4.1
	- Fix problems with pet group frames created in combat showing owner not pet.
	I forgot to set the attribute that I used in the restricted environment
	to set the unitsuffix on the frames when they're created.
	- Ticket #888, Taint problem with group frames created in combat.
	- Forgot to add localizations to Debug.lua
	- Ticket #891: ShortRace support for Goblin and Worgen races.
	- Fix showing the player's pets experience bar when on a vehicle that is not the same level as the player.
	- Ticket #876: Out of Phase indicator icon.
	Note: This may not work perfectly, due to a Blizzard bug.  If the phase
	transitions happens while you are too far away from the group member
	then no event will fire to update the change.
	- Disable group config modes for 4.0.3a as well for now.
	- Ticket #878, Fix a typo in the code.
