Tag as 1.4.0


--------------------

Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Hide the "Track Quest" checkbox in mini mode and fix a collision with the "Show Digsites" checkbox.
	- Allow usage of the "Toggle World Map Size" keybinding.
	- Be gone ;
	- Cache the returns of GetMapZones(id), as the function seems to be really slow, and the available zones per continent are not going to change while playing.
	- Hide the overlay tiles when switching to a map without any, like the contintent selector.
	- Remove the empty BC sections, they didnt get any maps =(
	- Directly pass the zone data table isntead of unpacking and select'ing over it, what was i thinking o.O
	- Fix scaling of the zone/continent dropdowns.
	- Add Classic and Cataclysm instances/raids to the zone dropdown (no maps for BC instances *sad*)
	- Improve performance in the FogClear module by caching texture references and disabling some Blizzard code that we overwrite anyway.
	- Updated FogClear data for the cataclysmic world.
	- Updated copyright header.
	- Properly deal with the floor dropdown.
