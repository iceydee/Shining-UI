L["FAQ_1_1"] = [=[|cffffffffWhat is this layout stuff?|r

kgPanels organizes panels to a layout. Each layout is stored globally, and any given character simply sets the active layout you wish to use.
]=] -- Requires localization
L["FAQ_1_2"] = [=[
|cffffffffI want to add a panel, but the create button(s) are greyed out. What am I doing wrong?|r

You have to have a layout selected. In the layout menu, click the layout you want to use, and activate it.
]=] -- Requires localization
L["FAQ_1_3"] = [=[
|cffffffffParenting and Anchoring|r

kgPanels supports using YOUR defined panel name for parenting. 
Do not use kgPanelsxxx for a parent name. Doing so may cause unspecified behavior, as kgPanels recycles frames as needed. 
So again if you create a panel called 'silly panel' you can use 'silly panel' as the parent and anchor name.
]=] -- Requires localization
L["FAQ_1_4"] = [=[
|cffffffffFinding frame names|r

kgPanels configuration system, adds a keybinding for the Framefinder. Under keybinding define a key for the frame finder
After that its as simple as hitting the key to bring up the frame finder and show you what frames are under the mouse.
]=] -- Requires localization
L["FAQ_2_1"] = [=[
|cffffffffHow do I add Artwork?|r

You use the artwork library to add new peices as you need. If you have shared media installed those items will also appear in the dropdown list.
]=] -- Requires localization
L["FAQ_2_2"] = [=[
|cffffffffWhy dont I see my color blending when I have a texture set?|r

Set your background style to gradiant or solid to blend the color into the texture.
]=] -- Requires localization
L["FAQ_2_3"] = [=[
|cffffffffHow do I change the border color?|r

Set the color in the main section for a given panel.
]=] -- Requires localization
L["FAQ_2_4"] = [=[
|cffffffffWhen i change the opacity I get mixed results|r

The main Opacity setting overrids the color opactiy.
]=] -- Requires localization
L["FAQ_3_1"] = [=[
|cffffffffI just added a texture to the library but I dont see it. What am I doing wrong?|r

When you add a texture you must be sure that WoW can see the directory and the file is spelled correctly. If you just added this file to disk, you will need to restart
WoW for it to pick up the new file in its path.
]=] -- Requires localization
L["FAQ_3_2"] = [=[
|cffffffffI added a border but it looks funny. Am I doing something wrong?|r

No, unfortunetly WoW doesnt always return a size for a texture, so kgPanels uses a default 50x50 size for borders. This may result in squished texture graphics for borders.
]=] -- Requires localization
L["FAQ_3_3"] = [=[
|cffffffffI want to mirror some texture art. How do I do that?|r

Use the flip horizontal option for the texture. To reverse top and bottom use flip vertical.
]=] -- Requires localization
L["FAQ_3_4"] = [=[
|cffffffffWhat is border edge size?|r

This is the size clipping used by WoW for borders. Changin this value will make your borders thicker or thinner as you change the value.
]=] -- Requires localization
L["FAQ_3_5"] = [=[
|cffffffffDoes kgPanels support SharedMedia?|r
Yes
]=] -- Requires localization
L["FAQ_4_1"] = [=[
|cffffffffI want to use a particular font, but the list only shows 'Blizzard'. How do I add more fonts?|r

Right now font support is limited. kgPanels will use any fonts available with SharedMedia. The other Option is to replace the default blizzard font ala Clearfont and ClearFont2

L["FAQ_5_1"] = [=[
|cffffffffScripting variables available|r
In any defined script the following variables are available:|r

|cffff6666self|r, which is always set to the panel invoking the script.|r

|cffff6666self.bg|r, this is the background art frame.|r

|cffff6666self.text|r, this is the fontstring for the frame.|r

|cffff6666kgPanels|r, this is a reference to the kgPanels object.|r

]=] -- Requires localization
L["FAQ_5_2"] = [=[
|cffffffffkgPanels script usable functions|r

|cffff6666kgPanels:FetchFrame(name)|r, this will get any frame defined in your layout.|r

|cffff6666kgPanels:ActivateLayout(name)|R, this allows you to switch layouts.|r

There are other functions, however without detailed knowledge of internal data structures it is advised you do not use them.|r
]=] -- Requires localization
L["FAQ_5_3"] = [=[
|cffffffffPassed in variables|r

Each handler passes in the upper level args, (see wowwiki Event api). 
The first variable is always self. 

OnEvent, we broke up the vararg so your function can simply reference arg1, arg2, arg3, etc..|r

OnUpdate provides the argument time|r

OnClick provides te argument button|r

]=] -- Requires localization
L["FAQ_5_4"] = [=[
|cffffffffI added an OnEvent script but it never fires. What am I missing?|r

In your OnLoad, register for the events you wish to receive. i.e.|r

self:RegisterEvent("PLAYER_LOGIN")|r

At this current time, Non WoW generated events are not available. So receiving AceEvent-3.0 only message wont trigger your OnEvent.|r
However if you so choose you can could embed AceEvent-3.0 into the frame reference. Please be aware this may cause you to receive events twice.|r
]=] -- Requires localization
L["FAQ_5_5"] = [=[
|CffffffffI added an OnClick/OnEnter/OnLeave script 
but nothing happens. What am I doing wrong?|r

You need to enable the mouse for the panel to receive those events.

L["FAQ_5_6"] = [=[
|cffffffffAre tehre some sample scripts?|r

Sample scripts will be posted on wowace.

L["FAQ_6_1"] = [=[
|cffffffffI tried to import a layout but nothign happened, whats going on?|r
Check your console, if the data failed to unpack their should be a message telling you why.

|cffffffffI tried to export but was unable to import. What happened?|r
Did you follow the status line to copy to your system clipboard?

L["FAQ_6_3"] = [=[
|cffffffffHow do I import my old eePanels setup?|r

Load up eePanels, go to the layout menu add a new name and click import
from eePanels. It will import as much as it can and try to guess parenting
as much as possible. Scripts DO NOT import from eePanels.
